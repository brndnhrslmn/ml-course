<h2>What is this?</h2>
This repo contains my solutions of the assignments in 2021 Stanford Machine Learning Course. If you are taking the class, fork my repo and put your own solutions in a different branch. HOWEVER, please DO NOT refer to any of the code in my repo before the due date and NEVER post any code in my repo according to the "Stanford Honer Code" below. Questions are always welcome, please contact me.

<h2>Stanford Honor Code</h2>
"We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises, you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students."
